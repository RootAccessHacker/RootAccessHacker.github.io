I have a BSc. degree in Network & Security Engineering and a particular interest in mathematics, physics, cryptography, reverse engineering, pentesting, CTF's, cryptograms and all the intelligence gathering disciplines; but particularly: OSINT, IMINT and SIGINT. On this blog all my CTF writeups and security research will be documented.
